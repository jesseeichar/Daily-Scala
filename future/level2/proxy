Writing Delegate classes in Scala is certainly not as nice as in Languages like C# or dynamic languages but it is substantially easier than in languages in Java because 
<code>
scala> class MF extends Proxy {        
     | val self = new java.io.File(".")
     | def listFiles = self.listFiles  
     | val compareTo = self compareTo _
     | }
defined class MF
</code>
