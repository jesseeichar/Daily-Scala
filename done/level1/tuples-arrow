Defined in the Predef object are several implicit methods.  All implicit methods defined in the Predef method are applicable to all programs without importing them.  One such method is the -> method.  This method is applicable to all objects and creates a Tuple2.  

Examples:
<pre><code>
// normal way to make a Tuple2
scala> (1,2)
res3: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

// another way to make a Tuple2 using the implicit -> method
scala> 1 -> 2
res2: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

// Creating a map using the normal tuples creation mechanism
scala> Map (("one",1),
     |      ("two",2))
res5: scala.collection.immutable.Map[java.lang.String,Int] = Map(one -> 1, two -> 2)

// -> syntax allows a second "prettier" way of creating the Map
scala> Map("one" -> 1,
     |     "two" -> 2)
res6: scala.collection.immutable.Map[java.lang.String,Int] = Map(one -> 1, two -> 2)
</code></pre>
