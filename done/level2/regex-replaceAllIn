A couple new methods have just been added to Scala 2.8 Regex.  You will need to download a version of Scala 2.8 more recent than Scala2.8-Beta1.  

The methods are related to replacing text using a regular expression and to say they are useful is an understatement.  Lets take a look:
<code>
scala> val quote = """I don&apos;t like to commit myself about heaven and hell - you see, I have friends in both places. 
     | Mark Twain"""                                                                                                
quote: java.lang.String = 
I don&apos;t like to commit myself about heaven and hell - you see, I have friends in both places. 
Mark Twain

scala> val expr = "e".r    
expr: scala.util.matching.Regex = e

/* 
This first method is not new or is it interesting.  But the new methods are both related
so lets start with the basic form of replaceAllIn
*/
scala> expr.replaceAllIn(quote, "**")
res1: String = 
I don&apos;t lik** to commit mys**lf about h**av**n and h**ll - you s****, I hav** fri**nds in both plac**s. 
Mark Twain

// this does the same thing
scala> quote.replaceAll("e","**")
res2: java.lang.String = 
I don&apos;t lik** to commit mys**lf about h**av**n and h**ll - you s****, I hav** fri**nds in both plac**s. 
Mark Twain

/*
Now things get interesting.  Using this form of replaceAllIn we can determine the replacement on a case by case basis.

The method takes a String => String function.  Very powerful. But even more powerful is the next method...
*/
scala> expr.replaceAllIn(quote, s => if(util.Random.nextBoolean) "?" else "*")
res5: String = 
I don&apos;t lik? to commit mys?lf about h?av?n and h?ll - you s*?, I hav? fri*nds in both plac*s.

/*
This method is fantastic.  It gives the Match object as the parameter so you have complete access to all
the matched groups, the location of the match etc...  

Using this method I have trimmed 20 lines of code down to 3 or 4.  I don&apos;t know how I survived without it

This example is simple.  The replacement is the location of the match
*/
scala> expr.replaceAllMatchesIn(quote, m => m.start.toString)                        
res6: String = 
I don&apos;t lik11 to commit mys26lf about h37av40n and h48ll - you s5960, I hav68 fri73nds in both plac90s.
