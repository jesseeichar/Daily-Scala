My first attempt at the Verified was to make it a mutable object (my Java tourettes kicking in).  But it cannot be covariant and mutable.  Look at the code to see why:
<code>
class Verified[+A <: V,V](assertion : (V) => Boolean, private var value : A){
    assert(assertion(value))
    
    def a = value
// update is illegal.  See the example below
    def update[ B >: A <: V](a : B) = value = a
}

def notNull(obj : AnyRef) = obj != null
val v = new Verified(notNull, "hi")

/*
Up to this point everything looks ok but the next line
will assign an object to value which is a reference to a String
*/
v update (new Object())
</code>
For Verified to be mutable A must be invariant.  If you look at the Mutable collections in Scala they are all invariant.  

Here is an interesting example of both invariant and covariant type parameters in a class hierarchy:
<code>
scala> class X[+A](val x :A)
defined class X

scala> class Y[A](var a: A) extends X[A](a)
defined class Y

scala> val x: X[Any] = new Y[String]("hi")
x: X[Any] = Y@1732a4df

scala> x.asInstanceOf[Y[String]].a="ho"
</code>
This example is perfectly legal because no matter how X[Any] is used no illegal assignment in Y can occur.  The interesting thing is that the object can be used in covariant usecases when only X is required.  This is now the collections in Scala can work.  

Here is a little example of collections invariance and covariance in action.  In List the parameter is covariant but in Buffer it is invariant  
<code>
scala> def printList(l : List[Any]) = print(l mkString " :: ")
printList: (l: List[Any])Unit

scala> val buffer = Buffer(1,2,3)
buffer: scala.collection.mutable.Buffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)

scala> printList(buffer)
1 :: 2 :: 3

/*
++ is part of Iterable.  Since Iterable is covariant ++ 
returns a new buffer it does not modify the existing buffer
All mutators are only defined on invariant traits
*/
scala> buffer ++ List(4)
res16: scala.collection.mutable.Buffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> res16 eq buffer
res17: Boolean = false

/*
buffer defines += to add an element to the buffer
so res27 is the same buffer with an extra element
*/
scala> buffer += 10
res27: buffer.type = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 10)

scala> res27 eq buffer
res28: Boolean = true
</code>
